    "author": "Dr Francesco Dergano",
    "intro": "Hydraulics is a fundamental branch of civil engineering that encompasses the study of fluid behavior and the design of hydraulic systems. It plays a crucial role in various applications such as water supply, wastewater management, drainage systems, and hydraulic structures. Mathematical formulas are essential tools in hydraulics, enabling engineers to analyze and design these systems accurately. These formulas allow for the calculation of critical parameters like flow rates, pressure drops, and velocities. Key formulas include the Bernoulli equation, Darcy-Weisbach equation, Manning's equation, and others related to flow measurement, pipe flow, and hydraulic structures. Understanding hydraulics and mathematical formulas is vital for civil engineers to make informed decisions during the design process, optimizing system performance and ensuring the efficient management of water resources. By applying mathematical principles, engineers can tackle complex challenges and develop sustainable solutions for hydraulic engineering projects.",
